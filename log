chore: update CHANGELOG with recent PHPStan fixes

Added entries to the CHANGELOG for fixes addressing PHPStan issues:
- Ensured displayKey($key); is called before returning in JWTGenerateSecretCommand.
- Added missing return true; statements in Expiration.php, IssuedAt.php, and NotBefore.php.
- Made the constructor final in Collection.php to fix new static() usage.
